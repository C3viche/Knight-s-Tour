Some Knight's tour improvements:
    - if tour takes longer than 5 minutes to find, then stop program
    - maybe print board a bit clearer for user
    - look for optimizations and clean up code

Github README.md draft:
    - Warnsdorff's rule, heuristic solution
    - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166218X04003488
        - really good article on optimized solution
    - if not running on mac, change CC value in makefile to gcc
    - will position knight with coordinates starting at 0 b/c not all chess boards have letters and numbers
        - 0,0 is top left
    - focuses purely on open tours
